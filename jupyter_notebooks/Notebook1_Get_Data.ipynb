    "# Notebook 01: Get Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Goal: Get the dataset needed for this tutorial \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Part 1 (if you haven't looked over Part 1, please do so before jumping into these notebooks), we will continue to use the [The Storm EVent ImagRy (SEVIR) dataset](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/fa78a16157fed00d7a80515818432169-Paper.pdf). Unfortunatley, the original SEVIR dataset is about 1 TB in size. Making things challenging because most will not have 1 TB free to play around with. Thus, to make a dataset that is more accessible we made ```sub-sevir```. \n",
    "\n",
    "```sub-sevir``` is a sub-sampled version of SEVIR. Specifcally, we re-sample all the images to have 48 x 48 pixels, which equates to about 8 km spatial resolution and only 1 hour of time (original has 4 hours). So in total each *scene* is the shape (12,48,48,4).\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the differences here are two youtube videos:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Original resolution](https://youtu.be/ntjNB0SAz1Y)\n",
    "2. [sub-sevir](https://youtu.be/UAEfD1p5uW8)\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is considerable differences in the resolution, there is still plenty of information content to do machine learning with. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the sub-sampling of SEVIR, the data size is now only 2 GB. Thus, **please make sure you have at least 2 GB of storage space avail**. before continuing here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Get Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is hosted on zenodo: [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7011372.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7011372). \n",
    "\n",
    "Zenodo is a free place to store files under 50 GB. What zenodo enables us to do is we can point something like wget right to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you dont want to use python to download the file, you can go to the above button and mannually download the file."
